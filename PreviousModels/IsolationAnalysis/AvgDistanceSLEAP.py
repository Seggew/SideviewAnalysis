# aim for this is to have all the distances between every pair of larvae in a video. From these pairs, I want to take a threshold of the distance between each pair and if it is below a certain value, this pair counts as clustering.
# one cluster has to be ≥3 animals. The %of animals engaged in a cluster across all frames will then be compared across videos and conditions
